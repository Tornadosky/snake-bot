# Snake-Bot
Telegram bot to classify three species of snakes or their absence

The idea of the project is a Telegram bot, that can classify 3 most common snakes in Eastern Europe.

At the moment, the classifier recognizes 3 types of snakes:
- **Grass snake** (natrix) (Common, water);
- **Viper** (Common, Steppe, Nikolski's, Dinnick's);
- **Copperheads**.

It can also determine the absence of a snake in the image. The selected 3 types of snakes are the most common in Belarus and neighbouring countries.
